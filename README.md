# LangLink

LangLink is a peer-to-peer messaging service that is built using Twilio's bot messaging API. By simply registering your name and preferred language, you can communicate with anyone across the world with any language. By harnessing the power of Microsoft Azure's neural network translation API, we have built an application that breaks down barriers and increases accessibility as it allows people to easily communicate without having to be fluent in the same language.
